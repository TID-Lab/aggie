# Aggie

Aggie is a web application for using social media and other resources to track incidents around real-time events such as elections or natural disasters.

Aggie can retrieve data from several sources:

* [Twitter](https://search.twitter.com) (tweets matching a keyword search)
* [Facebook](https://facebook.com) (comments from publicly accessible groups and pages)
* [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) (article titles and descriptions)
* [ELMO](http://getelmo.org) (answers to survey questions)

Items (called *reports*) from all sources are streamed into the application. Monitors can quickly triage incoming reports by marking them as *relevant* or *irrelevant*.

Relevant reports can be grouped into *incidents* for further monitoring and follow-up.

Reports are fully searchable and filterable via a fast web interface.

Report queries can be saved and tracked over time via a series of visual analytics.

Aggie is built for scalability and can handle hundreds of incoming reports per second. The backend fetching and analytics systems feature a modular design well-suited to parallelism and multi-core architectures.

Users can be assigned to *admin*, *manager*, *monitor*, and *viewer* roles, each with appropriate permissions.

Aggie is built using Angular.js and Express.js, both state-of-the-art development frameworks.

Contact mikeb@cc.gatech.edu for more information on the Aggie project.

[Sassafras Tech Collective](http://sassafras.coop) offers managed instances of Aggie, along with development and support services.

## Development Installation

### System requirements

The following need to be installed.

1. **node.js** (v.0.10.*, such as 0.10.32)
  - There are two ways to install/update node.js.
    1. Install a specific version of node.js.
      - Documentation and installation instructions can be found on the [node.js site](https://nodejs.org/).
    2. Use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
      - Node Version Manager (nvm) allows multiple versions of node.js to be used on your system and manages the versions within each project.
      - After installing nvm:
      1. in your terminal, navigate to the aggie project directory: `cd [aggie]`.
      2. use this command: `nvm use 0.10`.
2. **Mongo DB** (requires >= 2.6, such as 2.6.9)
  1. Follow the [installation structions](https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/) for your operating system.
  2. Stop and restart Mongo DB.
    1. On Linux run `sudo service mongod stop`. Then run `sudo mongod`.
    2. Make sure mongodb is running in the terminal and listening on an appropriate port. Your terminal with the mongo db process running should display something similar to the following: `[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017`.
  3. Note: You do not need to create a user or database for aggie in Mongo DB. These will be generated during the installation process below.


### Installation
1. Checkout the [aggie repo](https://github.com/TID-Lab/aggie).
  - In your terminal, navigate to your main projects folder (e.g. Documents).
  - Use this command: `git clone git@github.com:TID-Lab/aggie.git`.
1. Copy `config/secrets.json.example` to `config/secrets.json`.
  1. Set `adminPassword` to the default password your want to use for the `admin` user during installation.
1. Run `npm install` from the project directory.
  - This installs all dependencies, adds indexing support to MongoDB, creates an admin user, and concatenates the angular application.
1. In your terminal during 'npm install', a user and password were generated. You will use these credentials to log into the application. Example: `"admin" user created with password "password"`.
1. Run `npm install -g gulp mocha`.
  - This installs gulp and mocha globally so they can be run from the command line for testing.
1. Run `npm install -g migrate`.
  - This installs node-migrate globally.
1. To start server, run `npm start`.
1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
  - This will show you the running site. Login with the user name and password from your terminal mentioned above.

## Maintenance
1. To run migrations run `migrate`.
2. To run tests, run `npm test`.
3. To monitor code while developing, run `gulp`. You can pass an optional `--file=[test/filename]` parameter to only test a specific file.

## Project Configuration
You can adjust the settings in the `config/secrets.json` file to configure the application.

### Tests
Set `config.adminParty=true` if you want to run tests.

### Social Media and Feeds

#### Twitter
  1. Follow [these instructions](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens) to generate tokens to use the Twitter API.
  1. Go to Settings > Settings and edit the Twitter settings. Remember to toggle the switch on, once you have saved the settings.

#### Facebook
  1. Known issue: The current Facebook API is not compatible with Aggie. Please see https://github.com/TID-Lab/aggie/issues/139 for more information.
  1. Visit [your apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) on the Facebook developers site. Create a new app if needed.
  1. Inside your Facebook app, obtain `client_id` and `client_secret`.
  1. To obtain an access token, in a browser, visit `https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_secret=xxx&client_id=xxx&grant_type=client_credentials` using your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
  1. Go to Settings > Settings and edit the Facebook settings. Remember to toggle the switch on, once you have saved the settings.
  
#### ELMO
  1. Log in to your ELMO instance with an account having coordinator or higher privileges on the mission you want to track.
  1. In your ELMO instance, mark one or more forms as public (via the Edit Form page). Note the Form ID in the URL bar (e.g. if URL ends in `/m/mymission/forms/123`, the ID is `123`).
  1. Visit your profile page (click the icon bearing your username in the top-right corner) and copy your API key (click 'Regenerate' if necessary).
1. Go to Settings > Settings and edit the ELMO settings. Remember to toggle the switch on, once you have saved the settings.


### Emails
  1. `fromEmail` is the email address from which system emails come. Also used for the default admin user.
  1. `email.from` is the address from which application emails will come
  1. `email.transport` is the set of parameters that will be passed to [NodeMailer](http://www.nodemailer.com).
  1. If you are using SES for sending emails, make sure `config.fromEmail` has been authorized in your Amazon SES configuration.

### Fetching
  1. Set `fetching` value to enable/disable fetching for all sources at global level.
    - This is also changed during runtime based on user choice.

### Logging
  Set various logging options in `logger` section:
  - `console` section is for console logging. For various options, see [winston](see https://github.com/flatiron/winston#working-with-transports)
  - `file` section is for file logging. For various options, see [winston](see https://github.com/flatiron/winston#working-with-transports)
  - `SES` section is for email notifications. For various options, see [winston-amazon-ses](see https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston-amazon-ses).
    - Set appropriate AWS key and secret values.
    - Set `to` and `from` email ids. Make sure `from` has been authorised in your Amazon SES configuration.
    - **DO NOT** set `level` to *debug*. Recommended value is *error*.

## Using the Application
### Sources
#### Adding Sources
  1. Inside the application, go to `Sources > Create Source`.
  1. To add a Twitter search, add all relevant keywords.
    - Twitter has [more information on search terms](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/request-parameters#track).
  1. To add a Facebook source, copy and paste the URL of the Facebook group or page you want to follow (e.g. `https://www.facebook.com/nigerianforum`).
  1. To add an RSS feed, visit the website or blog you wish to use and find the RSS or other feed. (For example, `https://wordpress.org/news/feed/`).
  1. To add an ELMO source to track responses for a particular ELMO form, enter a URL like this: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/m/yourmission/responses.json?form_id=123`, where `123` is the ID of the form you noted above. The user associated with your API key must have permission to view responses on the mission in order for this to work.

#### Warnings
  As the application pulls in data, the app may encounter warnings. These warnings help determine whether or not a feed is pulling in data correctly.

  1. Go to `Sources`.
  2. In the `Name` column, click the appropriate source.
  3. Under `Recent Events`, you can see recent warnings for the source.


## Deployment
Internally, we use [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep Aggie
running. Since this is a multi-process application, the forever monitor will
sometimes hang up when restarting the Aggie process after deploying a new
version of the code. In this case, killing the forever process before deploying
seems to fix it.

## Architecture

Aggie consists of two largely separate frontend and backend apps. Some model code (in `/shared`) is shared between them.

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js/Express app responsible for fetching and analyzing data and servicing API requests. There are three main modules, each of which runs in its own process:

* API module
* Fetching module
* Analytics module

See README files in the `lib` subdirectories for more info on each module.

The model layer (in `/models`) is shared among all three modules.

### Frontend

The frontend is a single-page Angular.js app that runs in the browser and interfaces with the API, via both pull (REST) and push (WebSockets) modalities. It is contained in `/public/angular`.
