# Establishing the SMTC

## What is the SMTC?
**The Social Media Tracking Centre** (SMTC) serves as a physical space in which volunteers gather and work around the clock to monitor social media traffic via Aggie. SMTC members monitor and respond in real-time to reports from digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, ELMO, Ushahidi, and RSS feeds from blogs or traditional media sites. Key teams of the SMTC include the *tracking team*, the *veracity team*, the *escalation team*, the *leadership team* and the *embedded stakeholder team*. Team members need training on Aggie prior to the event been monitored. The SMTC Leadership Team is essential for coordinating activities in the centre. The diagram below indicates the operational flow of the various teams in the SMTC. ![SMTC Work Flow](smtc1.png)

## Key Term Definitions

### Tracking Team
The *tracking team* is responsible for reading through the real-time streams of social media reports aggregated by Aggie either in batches or by navigating through pages. Their workflow involves going through each report and creating an incident from actionable reports.

### Veracity Team
After the tracking team creates an incident, the *veracity team* takes over to investigate and verify the truthfulness of the incident created by trackers using some of the below strategies:
1.	Using social media platforms to communicate with the author of the report  (i.e. Tweeting at the author).
2.	Using triangulation to build evidence from other reports and sources.
3.	Contacting formal monitors in the field.
4.	Contacting relevant stakeholders.

### Escalation Team
Once the veracity team has confidently verified an incident to be true, the *escalation team* reports the incident to relevant stakeholders, providing all relevant information gathered.  The escalation team will move swiftly to address or resolve the situation.

### Stakeholder/Embedded Team
Embeds are key persons placed in civil organizations or government institutions invested in the coordination and supervision of the event being monitored. Embeds escalate verified incidents to these organizations, called stakeholders, which get more details about and respond to these incidents.
