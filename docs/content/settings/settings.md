6. With these access tokens, fellow the instructions from [Adding Media Feeds to Aggie](#adding-media-feeds-to-aggie) section and edit the Twitter settings in Aggie.

### WhatsApp messages

The WhatsApp feature is documented in a [conference paper](http://idl.iscram.org/files/andresmoreno/2017/1498_AndresMoreno_etal2017.pdf). As WhatsApp does not currently offer an API, a Firefox extension in Linux is used to redirect notifications from [web.whatsapp.com](http://web.whatsapp.com) to Aggie server. Thus, you need a Linux computer accessing WhatsApp through Firefox for this to work. Follow these steps to have it working.

  1. Install Firefox in Linux using your distribution preferred method.
  1. Install [GNotifier](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gnotifier/) add-on in Firefox.
  1. Configure the add-on [about:addons](about:addons):
       * Set Notification Engine to Custom command
       * Set the custom command to `curl --data-urlencode "keyword=<your own keyword>" --data-urlencode "from=%title" --data-urlencode "text=%text" http://<IP address|domain name>:2222/whatsapp`
           * We suggest setting your `keyword` to a unique string of text with out spaces or symbols, e.g., the phone number of the WhatsApp account used for Aggie. _This keyword must be the same one as the one specified in the Aggie application, when creating the WhatsApp Aggie source_.
           * Replace `IP address|domain` with the address or domain where Aggie is installed (e.g., `localhost` for testing).

     ![GNotifier Add-on for Firefox](gnotifier.png)

  1. Visit [web.whatsapp.com](http://web.whatsapp.com), follow instructions, and _enable browser notifications_
  1. Notifications will not be sent to Aggie when browser focus is on the WhatsApp tab, so move away from that tab if not replying to anyone.

### Google Places API

Aggie uses Google Places API to add location to the incidents, letting users to search for incidents by location. It also powers the maps generated by Aggie. Google accounts with a credit card get a higher free quota of API calls than those accounts without credit card.

1.  Get your key for [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps) from your Google account and copy it here. Remember to limit the domain to where Aggie is hosted (e.g., aggie.africanelections.org) when creating you new key.

### ELMO


1.  Log into your *ELMO* instance with an account having *coordinator* or higher privileges on the mission you want to track.
2.  In your ELMO instance, mark one or more forms as *public* (via the Edit Form page). *Note the Form ID in the URL bar (e.g. if URL ends in /m/mymission/forms/123, the ID is 123)*.
3.  Visit your profile page (click the **icon bearing your username** in the top-right corner) and copy your *API key* (click **'Regenerate'** if necessary).
4.  From Aggie, click **Settings > Configuration** and edit the ELMO settings. Remember to toggle the switch on, once you have saved the settings

## Email Settings

This must be set up to allow newly created users to receive emails from Aggie with their login credentials. Three transport options have been implemented using nodemailer.js:
1.  SMTP, which requires having access to a working SMTP server.
2.  Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).
3.  Sendgrid, an online mail service accessible through a simple API.

*In this example we are going to set up the email with Sendgrid’s service.*

1.  Click the **Settings** tab and select the **Configuration** option in the dropdown list.

    ![Email](email.png)

2.  Click **Edit** on the Email transport row of the email section (the last Edit).

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid1.png)

3.  Choose the *Transport method* as *SendGrid*.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid2.png)

4. Aggie then requests an *API key* for use with SendGrid as in the screenshot below.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid3.png)

### Generating SendGrid API Key

1.   Visit [SentGrid's Page](https://sendgrid.com/) and set up an account. Sendgrid will take one or two days to verify your account before activating it.
2.  From your account click the **Settings Menu** and select *API keys*
3.  Click the blue **Create API Key** on the top right.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid4.png)

4.  Select *General API key*.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid5.png)

5.  Type a name for the API e.g. *Aggie API key* and set the appropriate *permissions*. The only permission needed for this key is the ‘*Mail Send* ’ one.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid6.png)

6.  Click **Save** to *generate an API key* for use with Aggie.
7.  Copy the API key and paste it into the *api_key* field referred to in [Transport Email](#transport-email) section and click on Submit.

    ![Sendgrid](sendgrid3.png)

8.  Set the *App Email Address* as the email address you used for your SendGrid application.

## Widgets

Widgets are web components that can be added to webpages. In Aggie, widgets are used to display information for public consumption outside of the [SMTC](smtc). As usual, there is need to be careful with what information is made public, so use widgets with care so not to link individuals with information that may compromise them. At the moment there is only one widget available, the Public Incident Map. 

### Public Incident Map

The Public Incident Map displays those [incidents](#incidents) that have been marked [public](#creating_incidents) by the escalation team. It uses the Google Places API, and thus, should be [set](#google_places_api) before using the map.

1. *Center* and *zoom* define the main variables for the map. It will be centered in the country, city or other location you choose. The *zoom* variable specifies how large area will be displayed in the map.

1. You can see the result at https://<your-domain>/widget/public_incident_map.html

1. You can add the map to any webpage with the following code:
```
<iframe src="https://<your-domain>/widget/public_incident_map.html" width="xxx" height="yyy"></iframe>
```

1. Markers in the map have different meanings according to the their color, as shown in the table below. You can copy this table for your site if needed.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Map Key</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="marker-green.png" alt="Verified true" /></td>
<td>confirmed <strong>true</strong> incident</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><img src="marker-orange.png" alt="Verified false" /></td>
<td>confirmed <strong>false</strong> incident</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="marker-blue.png" alt="Unverified" /></td>
