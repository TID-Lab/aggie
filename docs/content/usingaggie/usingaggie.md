# Using Aggie

## Sources

### What is a Source?

Sources are the social media platforms such as *Twitter, Crowdtangle, Ushahidi, and RSS feeds* that Aggie crawls through to aggregate reports relevant to the event being monitored.

Sources can also be services that send reports directly to Aggie. Currently, we have implemented support for WhatsApp and [SMSGH](https://hubtel.com/messaging/), a service that forwards SMS text messages sent to [short codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code).

### Adding Sources to Aggie

1.  Click on **Sources** on the Header Menu of Aggie's main page.

    ![Sources](sources1.png)

2.  Click on the blue **Create Source** button on the left.
3.  Choose the *Source Media*.

    ![Sources](sources2.png)

4.  Enter a *Name* for the source.
5.  Copy and Paste the *URL* of the source page and click **Submit**.

    ![Sources](sources3.png)

### Warnings

As the application pulls in data, the app may encounter warnings. These warnings help determine whether or not a feed is pulling in data correctly.

1. Go to `Sources`.
1. In the `Name` column, click the appropriate source.
1. Under `Recent Events`, you can see recent warnings for the source.

## Reports Page Activities

### What is a Report?

A report is any post collected from a [source](#what-is-a-source). Examples include *tweets, Facebook posts and blog posts*.

### The Reports Page

From your Aggie header bar, click the **Reports** Tab. This will show you the reports page as indicated below.

![Sources](sources4.png)

### Actions on the Reports Page

There are several actions you can take on the reports page of Aggie. You can [Read reports](#reading-reports), [Flag reports](#flagging-reports), [Create Incidents](#creating-incidents),[Filter reports](#filtering-reports)  or add a report to an [Incident](#what-is-an-incident).  Besides the *filter bar* and the *action* and *navigation buttons*, there are eight columns on the Reports Page of Aggie.

### Sections of the Reports Page

  -   **The Checkbox column**:
This is used to select one or more reports that some actions can be applied to.
  -   **The Time column**:
This indicates the time the report was published on the source feed that Aggie collected the report from.
  -   **The Media column**:
This indicates the platform where the report was published.  
  -   **The Source column**:
This column indicates the name of the source, as set in the Sources tab In the case of Twitter, they all originate from Twitter search but, for example, each Facebook group or page is a separate source. Advisably, the source name should be set the same name as the social media account name.
  -   **The Author column**:
This indicates the social media account of the person who authored the report.
  -   **The Content column**:
This column shows the exact content of the report published by the author.
  -   **The Incident column**:
This column is used to add a report to an existing incident or create a new incident.
  -   **The Flagged column**:
This column is used to note/identify reports for reference.

### Navigating within the Reports page.

In order to navigate to and from pages, the blue navigation arrows below the filter bar are used.  

![Navigation](navigation.png)

### Reading Reports

There are two ways to read reports in Aggie. One way is to grab a batch using the *“Grab Batch”* button. The other is to go through reports on the reports page, navigating from one page to another using the *navigation buttons* on the reports page. Grabbing a batch is a faster and a more efficient way of reading reports in Aggie.

#### Reading using the "Grab Batch" button

The “*Grab Batch*” automatically pulls a set of ten unread reports that are displayed in batch mode. The batch mode is noted by the indication of a *blue bar* on the reports page. Users can take certain actions on these ten reports – such as [“flagging”](#flagging-reports) or [“adding reports to incidents”](#creating-incidents).  Upon completely taking desired action on the collected reports, trackers can grab another batch by clicking the “**Mark All Read & Grab Another**” button.

![Grab Batch](grab_batch.png)

#### Marking Reports as Read

A report can be manually marked as read. More than one reports can be marked as read by checking their respective checkboxes or with the “*Mark all Read*” button. When a tracker grabs a new batch, it is recommended that the tracker selects either *“Mark All Read & Grab Another”* or *“Mark All Read & Done”*. If the batch was accidentally grabbed, the tracker should click the *"Cancel"* button.

### Flagging Reports

A *flag* is a way of marking a report for future reference. Trackers might come across certain reports they wish to revisit and easily find. In situations like that, trackers can flag the report and then *filter* it latter by using *flagged reports* filter.

#### To Flag a Report

1.  Select the report(s) to be flagged using the *checkboxes* on each report row.
2.  Click the **Flag** tab beneath the filter bar if multiple reports are selected.
3.  You can flag a single message by clicking the **little flag** in the last column of the report’s row.

For example to flag the sixth report, you click on the *flag* in the last column of the first row. You notice that a report is flagged by the *light pink highlight* and the *black flag* on the report as indicated below.

![Flagged](flagged.png)

## Tags 
A tag is a method of categorizing reports at an individual level. Whereas incidents allow for clusters of reports based whether reports require action, tags allow for categorization of reports based on a report's qualities. In order to create a tag, you must have permission to do so.

### Creating Tags
1.  Navigate to the Tags page of the Aggie platform in order to create/edit/delete tags.

    ![Tags Page](tags_navigation.png)
    
2.  Click the **Create Tag** button in the heard of the Tags card.

    ![Tags_Create_Button](tags_creation.png)
    
3.  Fill out tag name (this is what is shown as the tag). Tag names can be edited after creation and will be updated on any reports it was applied to. Tags can only be 15 characters long.

    ![Tags_Form_Name](tags_form_name.png)
    
4.  Fill out tag color (this is what is shown as the tag's background color). Tag colors can be picked using the present color values or custom hex values. Tag color can be edited after creation and will be updated on any reports it was applied to.

    ![Tags_Form_Color](tags_form_colors.png)
    
5.  Fill out optional tag description (this is not shown but helps trackers understand what a tag is used for). Tag description can also be edited after creation.

    ![Tags_Form_Description](tags_form_description.png)
6.  Click the **Submit** to finish creating your tag.

### Deleting Tags
Removing tags will cause them to be removed from the reports they are added to. *Do not remove tags that are still in use*. If a tag change must be made, edit the tag.
1.  Navigate to the Tags page of the Aggie platform in order to delete tags. 

    ![Tags Page](tags_navigation.png)
    
2.  Click the **Trash Icon** located within the same row of the tag you would like to delete. 

    ![Tags_Delete_Button](tags_delete.png)
    
3.  You will receive a confirmation modal after you click the **Trash Icon**. Press the **Confirm** button to continue with deletion.

    ![Tags_Delete_Confirm](tags_delete_confirm.png)
    
### Editing Tags
Editing tags will cause an existing tag and all the Reports that contain that tag to update said existing tag. *This does not remove the tag from any reports*.  

1.  Navigate to the Tags page of the Aggie platform in order to edit tags. 

    ![Tags Page](tags_navigation.png)
    
2.  Click the **Pencil Icon** located within the same row of the tag you would like to edit. 

    ![Tags_Edit_Button](tags_edit.png)
    
3.  The form that appears upon clicking should be populated with the tag's previous information.

    ![Tags_Edit_Form](tags_edit_form.png)
    
4.  Fill the form with updated name/color/description. Then click submit to update the tag's properties.

    ![Tags_Edit_Submit](tags_edit_submit.png)
    
### Adding/Removing Tags to Reports
There are two methods of adding/removing tags to reports. Tags may be added to every report selected (similar to flagging multiple reports at once). The second method is adding tags to individual reports. 

#### Method 1: Adding/Removing Tags to Many Reports

1.  On the reports page (or the batch page), select the reports you would to add a tag to.

    ![Tags_Report_Selection](tags_report_multiselect.png)
    
2.  Then click the tag button on the left sidebar of the tag that you would like to add to each report. These tags operate as toggles. If all selected reports have that tag, it will remove that tag from each report selected. If none or only some of the reports have that tag, it will add that tag to each report selected.
    
    ![Tags_Report_ToggleTags](tags_report_tags.png)
   
3.  This should add the tag to each Report that was selected. Clicking that tag button again will remove the tag from the selected reports.

    ![Tags_Reports_Result](tags_reports_result.png)
    
#### Method 2: Adding/Removing Tags to a Single Report

1.  On the reports page (or the batch page), click the **Edit** text of the report row and tags column of the report you would like to edit. This functionality can also be accessed through the report details page.

    ![Tags_Report_Edit](tags_report_edit.png)
    
2.  The form that appears should have the selected report's information, and an input box to add and remove tags. Tags can be added by typing the full tag then pressing the **Enter** key, using autocomplete functionality, clicking tag dropdown options. Tags can be removed using the backspace key, clicking the **x** on each tag, or clearing all tags. None of these changes will take place until the **Submit** button has been pressed. 

    ![Tags_Report_Edit_Form](tags_report_edit_form.png)
    
3.  Click the **Submit** Button to finalize changes to the report's tags.

    ![Tags_Report_Edit_Submit](tags_report_edit_submit.png)
    
### Quick Removal of Tags on Single Report

1.  On the reports page (or the batch page), click a tag on a report row to remove the tag from that report.

    ![Tags_Report_Quick_Remove](tags_quickRemove.png)
    
2.  This will result in the removal of that tag from that report.

    ![Tags_Quick_Remove_Result](tags_quickRemove_result.png)
    
### Creating Incidents

#### Adding a report to an existing Incident

When trackers come across reports that, if verified, require action, they create an incident from that report. Or, if the report is associated with an already existing incident, the tracker may add the report to the existing incident.

#### Creating a New Incident

1.  Select the report(s) you are creating the *Incident* for by checking its/their *checkbox(es)* on the first column to the left fo the reports page.

    ![Incidents](incident_add.png)

2.  Click the **Add to Incident** button beneath the filter bar.

    ![Incidents](incidents.png)

3.  Select the related category of an *existing incident* to add the report to that incident or…
**If it's a new Incident**;
4. Click on the *blue* **Create a new Incident** link to create the new incident.

    ![Adding Incident](create_incident.png)

5.  Type in the *Title* of the incident (*e.g. Polling station not open, Voter intimidation etc*), the *Location* of the incident and a brief *note* describing the incident. Leave out the *veracity* and *assignment* fields for the veracity team and click **submit** to create a new incident. The verification and escalation team will be using the *note* field to keep track of the verification and escalation steps taken. 

6.  The *Public* and *Public Description* fields are used by the escalation team to add the incident to the list of public incidents. The *Public Description* will appear attached to the incident, for example, in the [Public Incident Map](#public_incident_map).

### Filtering Reports
